    "This project aims to investigate the differences in electroencephalography (EEG) signals between individuals with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and controls. We used two datapoints from Mitiadous et al. (2023), which contains scalp EEG recordings of AD patients, and healthy controls under eyes-closed rest. In this project, we will first apply signal processing techniques including filtering and artifact rejection remove noise and isolate the frequency range of interest. Our methodology includes the application of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to examine spectral components, followed by the computation of power spectral density (PSD) via the Welch method. Through this approach, we aim to quantify the relative band power across different frequency bands, allowing for a detailed comparison of neural activity between the two subjects."
